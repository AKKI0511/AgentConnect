# Multi-Agent Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to create and use multi-agent systems in the AgentConnect framework.

## Available Examples

*Coming soon*

Future examples will demonstrate:
- Collaborative problem-solving between multiple agents
- Agent specialization and role-based systems
- Orchestration of multi-agent workflows
- Complex communication patterns in multi-agent systems

## Running Examples

To run these examples (once available):

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install --with demo

# Run a multi-agent example
python examples/multi_agent/collaborative_agents.py
```

## Creating Your Own Multi-Agent Examples

When creating your own multi-agent examples, consider:

1. **Agent Roles**: Define clear roles and responsibilities for each agent
2. **Coordination Mechanisms**: Implement mechanisms for agent coordination
3. **Task Decomposition**: Show how to break down complex tasks
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Demonstrate how to handle conflicting agent goals or actions
