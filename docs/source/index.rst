AgentConnect Documentation
==========================

AgentConnect is a powerful framework for building autonomous AI agent systems that can communicate and collaborate effectively. It provides the infrastructure for human-agent and agent-agent interactions, enabling developers to create sophisticated AI applications with minimal effort.

Key Features
===========

* **Autonomous Operation**: Agents run independently with their own processing loops
* **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and Google AI
* **Secure Communication**: DID-based identity and cryptographic verification
* **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization
* **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Built-in tracing and debugging with LangSmith
* **Asynchronous Communication**: Reliable message passing between agents
* **Structured Conversations**: Organized conversation handling and state management
* **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent token usage management

==================

* :doc:`quickstart`: Get up and running quickly with basic examples
* :doc:`examples/index`: Explore example applications built with AgentConnect

==================
Core Components
==================

AgentConnect is built around three core components:

1. Communication Hub
===================

The central nervous system of AgentConnect, handling:

* Message routing between agents
* Agent registration and discovery
* Protocol enforcement
* Session management
* Asynchronous delivery

2. Agent System
==============

The intelligent actors in the system, featuring:

* Identity management (DID-based)
* Capability declaration and discovery
* Message signing/verification
* Autonomous processing loops
* LangGraph-based workflows

3. Provider Integration
======================

Flexible AI model integration with:

* Unified interface for multiple providers
* Automatic fallback mechanisms
* Streaming response support
* Token usage tracking
* Rate limiting
