## üìñ Overview

AgentConnect is a revolutionary framework for building and connecting *independent* AI agents.  Unlike traditional multi-agent systems that operate within a single, centrally controlled environment, AgentConnect enables the creation of a *decentralized network* of autonomous agents.  These agents can:

*   **Operate Independently:** Each agent is a self-contained system, potentially with its own internal multi-agent structure (using LangGraph, custom logic, or any other approach).
*   **Discover Each Other Dynamically:** Agents discover each other based on *capabilities*, not pre-defined connections.  This allows for a flexible and adaptable network.
*   **Communicate Securely:** Built-in message signing, verification, and communication protocols ensure secure interactions.
*   **Collaborate on Complex Tasks:** Agents can request services from each other, exchange data, and work together to achieve goals.
*   **Scale Horizontally:** The framework is designed to support thousands of independent agents, each with its own internal complexity.

AgentConnect empowers developers to create a truly decentralized ecosystem of AI agents, opening up possibilities for complex, collaborative AI applications that were previously impossible.

### Why AgentConnect?

*   **Beyond Hierarchies:** Break free from the limitations of traditional, centrally controlled multi-agent systems.
*   **True Agent Autonomy:** Build agents that are truly independent and can interact with any other agent in the network.
*   **Dynamic and Flexible:**  The network adapts as agents join, leave, and update their capabilities.
*   **Secure by Design:**  Cryptographic message verification and standardized protocols ensure secure interactions.
*   **Unprecedented Scalability:**  Designed to scale to thousands of interacting agents.
*   **Extensible and Customizable:**  Easily integrate custom agents, capabilities, and communication protocols.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AKKI0511/AgentConnect.git
cd AgentConnect

# Install dependencies
poetry install --with demo,dev

# Set up environment
copy example.env .env  # Windows
cp example.env .env    # Linux/Mac
```

Set required environment variables in your `.env` file:
```
# Required for AI providers (at least one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# Optional for payment capabilities
CDP_API_KEY_NAME=your_cdp_api_key_name
CDP_API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=your_cdp_api_key_private_key
```

For detailed installation instructions and configuration options, see the [QuickStart Guide](docs/source/quickstart.md) and [Installation Guide](docs/source/installation.md).

## üéÆ Usage

For detailed instructions on using AgentConnect, including the command-line interface, running examples, and building your own agents, see the [full documentation](https://AKKI0511.github.io/AgentConnect/).

*   [Running Examples](examples/README.md)
*   [Using the CLI](docs/source/usage.md)  *(To be created)*
*   [Building Custom Agents](docs/source/building_agents.md) *(To be created)*

## üíª Examples
AgentConnect includes several example applications to demonstrate different features:

- **Basic Chat**: Simple human-agent interaction
- **Multi-Agent System**: Collaborative agent workflows
- **Research Assistant**: Task delegation and information retrieval
- **Data Analysis**: Specialized data processing
- **Telegram Assistant**: Telegram AI agent with multi-agent collaboration
- **Agent Economy**: Autonomous workflow with automatic cryptocurrency payments between agents

For code examples and detailed descriptions, see the [Examples Directory](examples/README.md).

## üöÄ Demo Application
A full-featured demo application is included to showcase the framework's capabilities:

> **Note:** The UI demo is currently being refactored for a new version with improved features and better integration with the modular multi-agent system. In the meantime, we recommend using the CLI examples.

```bash
# Start the backend server
agentconnect --demo --backend-only

# Start the frontend (in a separate terminal)
cd demos/ui/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
For more information about the demo application, see the [Demo Documentation](demos/QUICKSTART.md).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

AgentConnect is built on three core pillars that enable decentralized agent collaboration:

1.  **Decentralized Agent Registry:**  A registry that allows agents to publish their capabilities and discover other agents.  This is *not* a central controller, but rather a directory service.  Agents can query the registry to find other agents that meet their needs.
2.  **Communication Hub:**  A message routing system that facilitates secure communication between agents.  The hub ensures reliable message delivery, but does *not* dictate agent behavior or control the network.
3.  **Independent Agent Systems:**  Each agent is a self-contained unit, built using the tools and frameworks of the developer's choice (LangGraph, custom logic, etc.).  Agents interact with the network through standardized protocols, but their internal workings are independent.

This architecture allows for a truly decentralized and scalable network of autonomous agents.
